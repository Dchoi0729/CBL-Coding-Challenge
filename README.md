## Description

This repository contains my solution to the CBL Coding Challenge.

## Additional Features

In addition to the requirements, I have implemented the following features:

- **CSS Styling:** Enhanced the overall styling to improve user experience.
- **Win Notification:** When a team wins, their name is highlighted in green for three seconds.
- **Winstreak Indicator:** If a team achieves a winstreak (more than 3 consecutive wins), a fire emoji ðŸ”¥ appears next to their name.

I hope these changes are acceptable!
